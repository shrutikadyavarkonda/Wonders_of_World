<th><h1><u>Chichen Itza</u></h1>
<hr size="5" color="black">
<hr size="5" color="black">
<h2>
<p align="justify">
Chichen Itza was a large pre-Columbian city built by the Maya people of the Terminal Classic period. The archaeological site is located in Tinúm Municipality
, Yucatán State, Mexico.Chichen Itza was a major focal point in the Northern Maya Lowlands from the Late Classic
 (c. AD 600–900) through the Terminal Classic (c. AD 800–900) and into the early portion of the Postclassic period (c. AD 900–1200). 
The site exhibits a multitude of architectural styles, reminiscent of styles seen in central Mexico and of the Puuc and Chenes styles of the Northern Maya lowlands. 
The presence of central Mexican styles was once thought to have been representative of direct migration or even conquest from central Mexico, 
but most contemporary interpretations view the presence of these non-Maya styles more as the result of cultural diffusion.
Chichen Itza was one of the largest Maya cities and it was likely to have been one of the mythical great cities, or Tollans, 
referred to in later Mesoamerican literature.[2] The city may have had the most diverse population in the Maya world, a factor that
 could have contributed to the variety of architectural styles at the site.[3]
The ruins of Chichen Itza are federal property, and the site's stewardship is maintained by Mexico's Instituto Nacional de
 Antropología e Historia (National Institute of Anthropology and History). The land under the monuments had been privately owned until 29 March 2010, 
when it was purchased by the state of Yucatán.[nb 2]</p>
<p align="justify">Chichen Itza is one of the most visited archaeological sites in Mexico with over 2.6 million tourists in 2017.
Chichen Itza is a complex of 17 structures featuring impressive step pyramids, old living quarters, and intricate stone carvings that will take you back in time.
When you first enter the complex, your eyes can’t miss the most notable structure in the center-- the Pyramid of Kukulcan. 
Also known as “El Castillo”, this pyramid is a great symbol of the Mayan’s fascination with astronomy.
 The four sides of the temple are each made 
with 91 stone steps, adding up to 365--the number of days in a year. </p>
<p align="justify">Kukulkan’s Descent is another unique feature exemplifying the Mayan’s extraordinary mathematical skills. 
The Pyramid of Kukulkan was built in such a way that when the sun sets during the spring and fall solstices, 
it will cast shadows resembling a large slithering snake along the building. Expect large crowds during these nights to see this unforgettable experience.
As you wander through the rest of Chichen Itza,  imagine the competitive sports played in the Great Ball Court, the diligent astronomy students in the 
“El Caracol” Observatory, and locals making sacrifices  at the Sacred Cenote to worship the Mayan rain god.
How to Visit & When to Go</p>
<p align="justify">
 The best time to visit Chichen Itza is when it first opens in the morning. By mid-morning, tour buses will arrive and can lead to huge crowds.
 Chichen Itza is open daily from 8 am to 5 pm and the entrance fee is 250 Mexican pesos (approximately $14 USD.) Avoid going on Sundays as
 this is when Mexican nationals get in for free and can get quite crowded.
Chichen Itza is located between Merida and Cancun. It’s possible to take the ADO bus to visit the Mayan ruins. First-class buses leave daily from downtown
 Cancun (3 hours away), Playa Del Carmen (3.5 hours away), and Tulum (2.5 hours away). You can also take a 1.5-hour-long direct bus ride from Merida on
 the weekends to reach Chichen Itza.</p>
<p align="justify">
If you’re on a tight budget, then consider a second class bus. However, it can take longer to reach your destination, so be sure to check the travel times. 
The bus will drop you off at the west entrance of Chichen Itza.
If renting a car during your stay, there are plenty of road signs showing the way to Chichen Itza. Before you go, familiarize yourself with local traffic laws and carry Mexican pesos to pay any tolls. Parking will be available for a small fee. 
Private transfers are also available to get to Chichen Itza. This is the best way to relax on your way to one of the most impressive sites in the world. 
Once inside the site, the only way to get around is by foot. 
To make your experience comfortable, educational and memorable, we recommend booking a tour, like those offered through Xichen.
 These tours will pick you up in luxury busses, provide meals and guided tours and even take you to visit a beautiful cenote along the journey.
 If you're looking for a more economical route, there are plenty of licensed guides for hire at the entrance to help you learn more about the
 Mayan culture and architecture. The gift store also sells guide books if you prefer a self-guided tour. If you’re looking to stay for a couple of days, 
consider the nearby colonial town of Valladolid. A 40-minute drive from Chichen Itza, Valladolid is a quiet town away from the tourists and is great 
for more of a local experience. It’s easy to take a bus to Chichen Itza from Valladolid and arrive early enough to avoid the crowds. 
 located at the northern tip of the Yucatán Peninsula of modern Mexico, was a Maya city which was later significantly influenced by the Toltec civilization. Flourishing between c. 750 and 1200 CE, the site is rich in monumental architecture and sculpture which promote themes of militarism and displays imagery of jaguars, eagles, and feathered-serpents. Probably a capital city ruling over a confederacy of neighbouring states, Chichen Itza was one of the great 
Mesoamerican cities and remains today one of the most popular tourist sites in Mexico.</p>
<p align="justify"><u>HISTORICAL OVERVIEW</u>
The name Chichen Itza probably derives from a large sinkhole known as the Sacred Cenote or 'mouth of the well of the Itza' into which the Maya threw offerings of jade and gold, and as the presence of bones testifies, human sacrifices. The early history of the site is still not clear, but settlement was certain by the Classic period (c. 250-900 CE). With the collapse of Teotihuacan, migrants may have come to the site from varying parts of Mesoamerica, and it seems likely there was contact with the Itza, a Maya group. A second period of construction seems to coincide with influence from the Toltec civilization. That Chichen Itza was a thriving trade centre with a port at Isla Cerritos is evidenced by finds of goods from elsewhere in Central America, for example, turquoise from the north, gold disks from the south, and obsidian from the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. 
The cultivation of cacao is known, and the city may have controlled the lucrative salt beds on the nearby northern coast.
DOMINATING CHICHEN ITZA IS THE HUGE PYRAMID OF KUKULCAN, ALSO KNOWN AS THE CASTILLO.
The city has been traditionally divided into two distinct parts and periods, 
even if there is some overlap both in time and design, and together they cover some 16 square kilometres. 
The earliest, in the south, is native Maya dating to the Epiclassic period (c. 800-1000 CE) with buildings displaying the distinct 'Puuc' 
architectural style and Maya hieroglyphs. The plan is more spread out than other parts of the city and, constructed on a roughly north-south axis, 
may reflect the course of the Xtoloc Cenote water source.
<p align="justify"> The second part of the city has been traditionally dated to 1000-1200 CE and is more mysterious, creating one of the most contentious debates in
 Mesoamerican archaeology. Built in the Florescent style and along a more ordered plan, it displays many hallmarks of the Toltec civilization, leading
 scholars to believe that they either conquered Chichen Itza as they expanded their empire from their capital Tula over 1,000 km away, or there was some
 sort of cultural and trade sharing between the two centres. Common features between the two cities found in architecture and relief sculpture include warrior
 columns, quetzal-feathered rattlesnakes, the clothing of subjects, chacmools (sacrificial basins in the form of a reclining person), atlantides (support columns in
 the form of standing males), the representation of certain animals, a tzompantli (sacrificial skull rack), Tlaloc (the rain god) incense burners, and personal names
 represented by glyphs which are present at both sites but which are not Maya.</p>
