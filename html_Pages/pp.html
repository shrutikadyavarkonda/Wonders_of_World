<p align="justify">The Puerto Princesa Subterranean River National Park is a protected area of the Philippines located about 80 kilometres (50 mi) north of the city centre of
 Puerto Princesa, Palawan. The river is also called Puerto Princesa Underground River. The national park is located in the Saint Paul Mountain Range on the
 western coast of the island. It is bordered by St. Paul Bay to the north and the Babuyan River to the east. The City Government of Puerto Princesa has managed 
the National Park since 1992. The entrance to the subterranean river is a short hike or boat ride from the town Sabang.
In 2010, a group of environmentalists and geologists discovered that the underground river has a second floor, which means that there are small waterfalls 
inside the cave. They also found a cave dome measuring 300 m (980 ft) above the underground river, rock formations, large bats, a deep water hole in the
 river, more river channels, and another deep cave, as well as marine creatures and more. Deeper areas of the underground river are almost impossible to 
explore due to oxygen deprivation.On November 11, 2011, Puerto Princesa Underground River was provisionally chosen as one of the New7Wonders of Nature. 
This selection was officially confirmed on January 28, 2012.
Deep underground on the island of Palawan in the Philippines lies the Puerto Princesa River. Both a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the
 ‘New 7 Wonders of Nature’, it’s the world’s longest navigable underground river and makes for an exciting experience in one of the Philippines’ 
most popular islands.</p>
<p align="justify">
Here’s everything you need to know about exploring the Puerto Princesa Underground River.
Wait, an underground river? How is that possible?
Yep, that’s right. In fact, the river flows directly underneath the St Paul Mountain Range, found on the mid-western coast of Palawan. 
The river channeled its way through a series of vast chambers and caverns over millions of years ago.
The cave system stretches for a total of 24km underneath the mountains, and the river itself winds its way through 8.2km of it. Besides being
 one of the longest underground rivers in the world, the PPUR is also one of the very few that outflows directly to the sea.
The river and caves are home to complex eco-system that has adapted to living underground here over hundreds of years. Many of the animals in the caves are found only here, including certain types of giant spiders, crabs, fish and snakes, although bats
 and swallows are likely to be the only ones you’ll see.</p>
<p align="justify">

Is it worth the trip?<br>
Yes, absolutely. It's an otherworldly experience: imagine paddling through the dark in a small boat – the boatman’s headlamp the
only light guiding your way – while the soft click-click of bats, chirps of swallows and the echoey drip, drip of water from the roof is your
 soundtrack. You glide through giant cavernous cathedrals, past mushroom-shaped rocks, in-between candle-like spindles of limestone and into
 some of the darkest reaches of the underbelly of the cave.
Tours only take visitors up to the 4km mark, Conquer your fears of small, dark spaces however, and you’ll be treated to the rare sights of 
waterfalls gushing through the cave walls, a unique 20 million-year-old fossil of a sirenia or manatee, and a tiny rock passage that leads into a 
vast room,carpeted from floor to ceiling in glimmering crystals.
Even the journey to the cave itself is worth it: you’ll enjoy a scenic 20-minute boat ride across the sea, past towering limestone karsts and walk through the national park, home to monkeys swinging through the tree canopies and giant monitor lizards slinking their way through the undergrowth.
</p><p align="justify">
So how can I visit?<br>
The jumping-off point is the small village of Sabang, located around 40km north of the capital of the island – Puerto Princesa. You can either choose to 
visit on a day-trip from the capital or stay in Sabang itself, which also has a lovely beach, a couple of luxury resorts and plenty of cheap beach huts for 
backpackers.</p>

Everyone wanting to visit the underground river must apply for a permit to do so, and because of limited capacity and high demand, it’s best to book a few
 days in advance. You can either visit on an organised tour or arrange the permit and boat ride yourself, and pay for everything separately.
