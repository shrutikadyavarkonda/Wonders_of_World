<th><h1><u>Table Mountain</u></h1>
<hr size="5" color="black">

<h2>
<p align="justify">
Table Mountain is the most iconic landmark of South Africa.
It is also the country’s most photographed attraction and its famous cable car took millions of people to its top.Table Mountain has become the single most 
welcoming icon to not only our people, but travellers from all over the world.But this mountain hides many surprises that wait to be discovered.
It is much more than a scenic photograph background or a place from where you can take a breathtaking photo of Cape Town.
There are about 2,200 species of plants found on Table Mountain and 1470 floral species. Many of these plants and flowers are endemic to this mountain.
The magnificent Kirstenbosch Botanical Gardens are found on the eastern foot of the mountain. Founded in 1913, the garden that spans an area of 1300 acres
 includes a unique conservatory with plants from different parts of the world.Besides the parks, the whole area has a biodiversity that is rare to find in
 other places on earth. Its many valleys and streams make it an idyllic getaway from Cape Town. The national park’s most unique feature is its fynbos
 vegetation that is displayed here better than anywhere in the world.The Cape Floral region of the national park is one of the richest floral regions in the world.
 Over 70% of the flowers are endemic to the Table Mountain. It is no wonder that the mountain was chosen as one of the new seven world wonders.
Its fauna is no less thrilling either. Although animals such as the cape lion, mountain zebra or the leopard are no longer found here, the park is still home to
 caracals, rock hyraxes or chacma baboons.At the Boulders, penguins flock all over the place, a unique sight in Africa.The flat top peak of the mountain reaches 
1,086 m above sea level, but being so close to the sea and to the city its features look more imposing.Besides the mountain, the national park contains another one 
of South Africa’s attractions, the Cape of Good Hope, the most southern point of the African continent.Explore Cape Town’s iconic  Table Mountain
Whether it is covered in a blanket of moody clouds or showing off against a crisp cloudless blue sky, Table Mountain is always spectacular.</p>
<p align="justify">
Cape Town locals are pretty fond of the mountain that looms over their city… and with good reason! Table Mountain, which is home to the richest, yet smallest
 floral kingdom on earth, was voted one of the New Seven Wonders of the World in 2011.</p>

<p align="justify">Flanked by Devil’s Peak and Lion’s Head, Table Mountain makes up the northern end of the Cape Fold Mountain range. It’s hard to imagine, but the mountain’s
 distinctive flat top – a three-kilometre level plateau – was once the bottom of a valley! The mountain was given its name — Taboa do Cabo
 (Table of the Cape) — by Antonio de Saldahna after he climbed up Platteklip Gorge in 1503.</p>

<p align="justify">Legend has it that the tablecloth of clouds that pours over the mountain when the southeaster blows is
the result of a smoking contest between the devil and a retired sea captain called Jan van Hunks.

 Fauna and flora
<p align="justify">You don’t have to know much about plants to appreciate Table Mountain’s rich biodiversity. The 57-square-kilometre area comprising Table Mountain and the
 Back Table is home to more than 1470 floral species, many of them endemic to the area. The vegetation is mainly endangered Peninsula 
Sandstone Fynbos, but you’ll also find critically endangered Peninsula Granite Fynbos, Peninsula Shale Renosterveld, and small sections of Afromontane forest.</p>
<p align="justify">
While leopards once roamed the mountain — but not since the 1920s — the biggest cat you are likely to see (if you are very lucky) is the rooikat (caracal). 
The mountain is also home to dassies (rock hyrax), porcupines, mongooses, snakes, tortoises, and a rare amphibian called the Table Mountain Ghost Frog. 
On the raptor front, you might catch a glimpse of jackal buzzards, booted eagles, African harrier-hawks, peregrine falcons and rock kestrels.
