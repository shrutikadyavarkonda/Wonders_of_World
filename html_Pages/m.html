<p align="justify">Machu Picchu is a 15th-century Inca citadel, located in the Eastern Cordillera of southern Peru, on a mountain ridge 2,430 metres
 (7,970 ft) above sea level.[11][12] It is located in the Cusco Region, Urubamba Province, Machupicchu District in Peru,[13] above the Sacred Valley,
 which is 80 kilometres (50 mi) northwest of Cuzco and through which the Urubamba River flows, which cuts through the Cordillera and originates a 
canyon with a tropical mountain climate.[14]
Most archaeologists believe that Machu Picchu was constructed as an estate for the Inca emperor Pachacuti (1438–1472). Often mistakenly referred to
 as the "Lost City of the Incas" (a title more accurately applied to Vilcabamba), it is the most familiar icon of Inca civilization. The Incas built the 
estate around 1450 but abandoned it a century later at the time of the Spanish Conquest. Although known locally, it was not known to the Spanish 
during the colonial period and remained unknown to the outside world until American historian Hiram Bingham brought it to international attention in 1911.
Machu Picchu was built in the classical Inca style, with polished dry-stone walls. Its three primary structures are the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun,
 and the Room of the Three Windows. Most of the outlying buildings have been reconstructed in order to give tourists a better idea of how they originally
 appeared.[15] By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored[15] and restoration continues.[16]
Machu Picchu was declared a Peruvian Historic Sanctuary in 1981 and a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983.[12] In 2007, Machu Picchu was voted one
 of the New Seven Wonders of the World in a worldwide Internet poll.
The Historic Sanctuary – National Archaeological Park of Machupicchu (SHM-PANM) is a cultural and natural area inscribed on UNESCO’s World Heritage List.
 With an extension of 37302 hectares, it is one of the most biodiverse areas in Peru and harbors more than 
60 archaeological monuments linked by a complex Inka road network.</p>

<p align="justify">The most important monument inside the HSM-NAPM is the llaqta or Inka City of Machupicchu, which was planned and built around 1450 CE during the
 reign of Inka Pachakuti. Its construction demanded the participation of specialists in architecture, engineering, astronomy, and massive amounts of labor.
 More than 50% of the work required for its erection was focused on site preparation, the foundation and the drainage system. Its construction responds to 
the need of the Inka State to have a religious, political and administrative center within a sacred space that is the link between the Andes and the Amazon.
The llaqta of Machupicchu was abandoned during the second half of the sixteenth century; however, it was never lost as it was occasionally visited and inhabited
 by local farmers. Some colonial documents refer to the Inka llaqta of Machupicchu as the "Settlement of the Incas" or the "Old Village of the Inga Named
 Guaynapicchu". In 1874, the names "Machu Picchu" and "Huaina Picchu" appear for the first time in a cartographic document, which was prepared by engineer
 Herman Göhring. In 1911, Professor Hiram Bingham visited the llaqta and was impressed with its beauty and majesty. The following year he returned with a
 multidisciplinary team of professionals who conducted excavations and research in the area.
Since the 1930’s, the Peruvian government has been promoting the research, conservation, and enhancement of the Historic Sanctuary 
and the llaqta of Machupicchu, which represents a masterpiece of art, architecture, and engineering in perfect harmony with nature and is 
the most important legacy the Inka civilization left to mankind.</p>
