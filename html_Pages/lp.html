<th><h1><u>La Paz</u></h1>

<p align="justify">

La Paz , officially known as Nuestra Señora de La Paz , also named Chuqi Yapu (Chuquiago) in Aymara, is the seat of government and the de facto national capital of the Plurinational State of Bolivia (the constitutional capital of Bolivia is Sucre). With an estimated 789,541 residents as of 2015, La Paz is the third-most populous city in Bolivia (after Santa Cruz de la Sierra and El Alto). Its metropolitan area, which is formed by La Paz, El Alto and Viacha, makes up the most populous urban area in Bolivia, with a population of 2.3 million.It is also the capital of the La Paz Department.

The city, located in west-central Bolivia 68 km (42 mi) southeast of Lake Titicaca, is set in a canyon created by the Choqueyapu River. It is located in a bowl-like depression surrounded by the high mountains of the Altiplano. Overlooking the city is the towering, triple-peaked Illimani. Its peaks are always snow covered and can be seen from many parts of the city. At an elevation of roughly 3,650 m (11,975 ft) above sea level, La Paz is the highest capital city in the world. Due to its altitude, La Paz has an unusual subtropical highland climate, with rainy summers and dry winters.

La Paz was founded on October 20, 1548 by the Spanish conquistador Captain Alonso de Mendoza at the site of the Inca settlement of Laja as a connecting point between the commercial routes that led from Potosí and Oruro to Lima; the full name of the city was originally Nuestra Señora de La Paz (meaning Our Lady of Peace) in commemoration of the restoration of peace following the insurrection of Gonzalo Pizarro and fellow conquistadors against the first viceroy of Peru. The city was later moved to its present location in the valley of Chuquiago Marka. La Paz was under Spanish colonial rule as part of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata, before Bolivia gained independence. Since its founding, the city was the site of numerous revolts. In 1781, the indigenous leader and independence activist Túpac Katari laid siege to the city for a total of six months, but was finally defeated. On July 16, 1809 the Bolivian patriot Pedro Domingo Murillo ignited a revolution for independence, marking the beginning of the Spanish American Wars of Independence, which gained the freedom of South American 
states in 1821.</p>
<p align="justify">

As the seat of the government of Bolivia, La Paz is the site of the Palacio
 Quemado, the presidential palace. It is also the seat of the Bolivian legislature,
 the Plurinational Legislative Assembly, and numerous government departments and agencies.
 The constitutional capital of Bolivia, Sucre, retains the judicial power.The city hosts
 all the foreign embassies as well as international missions in the country. La Paz is
 the political and financial center of Bolivia; it generates 27% of Bolivia's Gross Domestic 
Product and serves as the headquarters for numerous Bolivian companies and industries.</p>
<p align="justify">
La Paz is also an important cultural center of Latin America, as it hosts several landmarks 
belonging to the colonial times, such as the San Francisco Church, the Metropolitan Cathedral,
 the Plaza Murillo and the Jaén Street. The city is renowned for its unique 
markets, particularly the Witches' Market, and for its vibrant nightlife. Its unusual 
topography offers unique views of the city and the surrounding mountains of the Cordillera 
Real from numerous natural viewing points. La Paz is also home to the longest, highest and 
most modern urban cable car network in the world. In May 2015, it was officially recognized 
as one of the New 7 Wonders Cities together with Beirut, Doha, Durban, Havana, Kuala Lumpur 
and Vigan. La Paz is listed on the Global Cities Index 2015, and is considered a global city
 type "Gamma" by Globalization and World Cities Research Network (GaWC).</p>
<p align="justify">
The city of La Paz has a consistently decreasing volume of colonial buildings, mostly centered around the vicinity of the Plaza Murillo. Due to a lack of funds and the inability of property owners to pay for restorations to colonial buildings, many have been torn down, or are in a dilapidated state. As historic buildings are more expensive to keep, land owners find it less of a burden to construct more modern buildings as opposed to keeping the old ones. Although there has been an increasing number of projects and propositions to restore some of the city's colonial buildings, the future of these historic edifices remains uncertain.
The economy of La Paz has improved greatly in recent years,[when?] mainly as a result of improved political stability. Due to the long period of high inflation and economic struggle faced by Bolivians in the 1980s and early 1990s, a large informal economy developed. Evidence of this is provided by the markets found all around the city. While there are stable markets, almost every street in the downtown area and surrounding neighborhoods has at least one vendor on it. La Paz remains the principal center of manufacturing enterprises that produce finished-product goods for the country, with about two-thirds of Bolivia's manufacturing located nearby. Historically, industry in Bolivia has been dominated by mineral processing and the preparation of agricultural products. However, in the urban centre of La Paz, small plants carry out a large portion of the industry. Food, tobacco products, clothing, various consumer goods, building materials, and agricultural tools are produced. "The tin quotations from London are watched in La Paz with close interest as an index of the country's prosperity; a third of the national revenue and more than half of the total customs in 1925 were derived from tin; in short, that humble but indispensable metal is the hub around which Bolivia's economic life revolves. The tin deposits of Bolivia, second largest in the world, ... invite development."
