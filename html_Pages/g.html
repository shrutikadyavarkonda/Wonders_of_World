<hr size="5" color="black">
<hr size="5" color="black">
<p align="justify">The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications made of stone, brick, tamped earth, wood, and other materials, generally built along an 
east-to-west line across the historical northern borders of China to protect the Chinese states and empires against the raids and invasions of the 
various nomadic groups of the Eurasian Steppe with an eye to expansion. Several walls were being built from as early as the 7th century BC;[2]
 these were later joined together and made bigger by Qin Shi Huang (220–206 BC), the first Emperor of China. Little of that wall remains.[3] Later on,
 many successive dynasties have repaired, maintained, and newly built multiple stretches of border walls. The most well-known of the walls were built
 during the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644).</p>

	<p align="justify">Apart from defense, other purposes of the Great Wall have included border controls, allowing the imposition of duties on goods transported along 
the Silk Road, regulation or encouragement of trade and the control of immigration and emigration. Furthermore, the defensive characteristics of the 
Great Wall were enhanced by the construction of watch towers, troop barracks, garrison stations, signaling capabilities through the means of smoke or
 fire, and the fact that the path of the Great Wall also served as a transportation corridor.
The frontier walls built by different dynasties have multiple courses. Collectively, they stretch from Dandong in the east to Lop Lake in the west, 
from present-day Sino-Russian border in the north to Qinghai in the south; along an arc that roughly delineates the edge of Mongolian steppe. 
A comprehensive archaeological survey, using advanced technologies, has concluded that the walls built by the Ming dynasty measure 8,850 km (5,500 mi).[4] 
This is made up of 6,259 km (3,889 mi) sections of actual wall, 359 km (223 mi) of trenches and 2,232 km (1,387 mi) of natural defensive barriers such as hills and 
rivers.[4] Another archaeological survey found that the entire wall with all of its branches measures out to be 21,196 km (13,171 mi).[5] Today, 
the Great Wall is generally recognized as one of the most impressive architectural feats in history.
Who Built the Great Wall and Why the "Long Wall" has a long history — more than 2,300 years. It was built in different areas by different states/dynasties to protect different territorial borders.
Why the Great Wall Was Built</p>
 <p align="justify">1.To prevent invasion<br>
 2.To protect Silk Road trade<br>
<p align="justify">In the Qin Dynasty, the First Emperor of Qin inked the northern walls to prevent invasion from northern nations. In the Han Dynasty, the emperors extended the
 Great Wall far into today's western China to protect Silk Road trade.</p>
<p align="justify"><b>how the great wall is built</b></p>
 <p align="justify">The majestic Great Wall was built with wisdom, dedication, blood, sweat,
 and tears. Families were separated, and many workers died and were interred as part of the
 Great Wall itself.<br>
Workers: soldiers, peasants, rebels<br>
Materials: stone, soil, sand, brick<br>
Material delivery: by hand, rope, cart, goat<br>
Read more on How the Great Wall Was Built — Materials and Methods: See who the workers were,
 their construction techniques, and how they moved the huge amount of materials.<br>
<p align="justify">How Tall Is the Great Wall?<br>
The height of the Great Wall is 5–8 meters (16–26 feet), where intact/restored.
 It was designed to be at least three times the height of a man. 
Some of the Wall was built along ridges, which make it look taller.</p><br>

<p align="justify">The Great Wall's Structure — Walls, Watchtowers, Fortresses…<br>
the great wallA watchtower at the Great Wall<br></p>
<p align="justify">The Great Wall was not just a wall. It was an integrated military defensive system with watchtowers for surveillance, fortresses for command posts and logistics, beacon towers for communications, etc.
In the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644), the Great Wall was reconstructed to be stronger and more sophisticated, due to better construction techniques being developed.
The wall body: The Ming Great Wall usually had battlements 1.8 meters (6 feet) high with loopholes and crenels, and parapet walls 1.2 meters (4 feet) high.
Flanking towers: Every 500 meters or less (1,640 feet) on the Great Wall there was a flanking tower allowing defenders to shoot arrows at attackers at the face
 of the wall.Fortresses were built at important/vulnerable access points (passes), such as Shanhai Pass Fortress, Juyong Pass Fortress, and Jiayu Pass Fortress. 
There were many archery windows and gates on the forts. The fortress gatehouses were the strongest and most impregnable structures on the Great Wall.

Due to natural erosion and human damage, about 2,000 kilometers, or 30% of the Ming Great Wall has disappeared. (Far more of previous dynasties' Great Wall sections is gone.)
Restoration and Protection to the Great Wall
