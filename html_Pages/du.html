Durban is the third most populous city in South Africa—after Johannesburg and Cape Town—and the largest city in the South African province of KwaZulu-Natal. Located on the east coast of South Africa, Durban is famous for being the busiest port in the country. It is also seen as one of the major centres of tourism because of the city's warm subtropical climate and extensive beaches. Durban forms part of the eThekwini Metropolitan Municipality, which includes neighboring towns and has a population of about 3.44 million, making the combined municipality one of the biggest cities on the Indian Ocean coast of the African continent. It is also the second most important manufacturing hub in South Africa after Johannesburg. In 2015, Durban was recognised as one of the New7Wonders Cities (along with Vigan, Doha, La Paz, Havana, Beirut, and Kuala Lumpur).
Archaeological evidence from the Drakensberg mountains suggests that the Durban area has been inhabited by communities of hunter-gatherers since 100,000 BC. These people lived throughout the area of present-day KwaZulu-Natal until the expansion of Bantu farmers and pastoralists from the north saw their gradual displacement, incorporation or extermination. Little is known of the history of the first residents, as there is no written history of the area until it was sighted by Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama, who sailed parallel to the KwaZulu-Natal coast at Christmastide in 1497 while searching for a route from Europe to India. He named the area "Natal", or Christmas in Portuguese.
Durban is ethnically diverse, with a cultural richness of mixed beliefs and traditions. Zulus form the largest single ethnic group. It has a large number of people of British and Indian descent. The influence of Indians in Durban has been significant, bringing with them a variety of cuisine, culture and religion.

In the years following the end of Apartheid there was a population boom as Africans were allowed to move into the city. The population grew by 2.34% between 1996 and 2001. This led to shanty towns forming around the city which were often demolished. Between 2001 and 2011 the population growth slowed down to 1.08% per year and shanty towns have become less common as the government builds low-income housing.
</p><p align="justify">
The population of the city of Durban and central suburbs such as 
Durban North, Durban South and the Berea increased 10.9% between 2001 
and 2011 from 536,644 to 595,061. The number of Black Africans increased
 while the number of people in all the other racial groups decreased. Black 
Africans increased from 34.9% to 51.1%. Indian or Asians decreased from 27.3% to
 24.0%. Whites decreased from 25.5% to 15.3%. Coloureds decreased from 10.26% to 
8.59%. A new racial group, Other, was included in the 2011 census at 0.93%.</p>
<p align="justify">
The city's demographics indicate that 68% of the population are of working age, and 38% of the people in Durban are under the age of 19 years.

It has the highest number of dollar millionaires added per year of any South African city with the number rising 200 per cent between 2000 and 2014.
Durban has a number of informal and semi-formal street vendors. The Warwick Junction Precinct is home to a number of street markets, with vendors selling goods from traditional medicine, to clothing and spices.

The city's treatment of shack dwellers has been strongly criticised by a report from the United Nations linked Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions and there has also been strong criticism of the city's treatment of street traders, street children and sex workers. Durban is known throughout the world for its strain of cannabis called 'Durban Poison'. It is one of the most common strains sold by car guards and street dealers throughout eThekweni.
Durban has a long tradition as a port city. The Port of Durban, formerly known as the Port of Natal, is one of the few natural harbours between Port Elizabeth and Maputo, and is also located at the beginning of a particular weather phenomenon which can cause extremely violent seas. These two features made Durban an extremely busy port of call for ship repairs when the port was opened in the 1840s. Durban is now the busiest port in South Africa, as well as the third busiest container port in the Southern Hemisphere.

MSC Cruises bases the MSC Musica in Durban from November to April every year. 
From the 2019/2020 Southern Africa cruise season MSC Cruises will be basing the newer 
MSC Orchestra in Durban. Durban is the most popular cruise hub in Southern Africa. 
Cruise destinations from Durban on the MSC Musica include Mozambique, Mauritius, Réunion,
 Madagascar and other domestic destinations such as Port Elizabeth and Cape Town. Many other
 ships cruise through Durban every year, including some of the worlds biggest, such as the
 RMS Queen Mary 2, the biggest ocean liner in the world. Durban will be building a brand new
 R200 million cruise terminal that will be operational in October 2019, the Durban Cruise
 Terminal. The tender was awarded to KwaZulu Cruise Terminal (Pty) Ltd which is 70% owned 
by MSC Cruises SA and 30% by Africa Armada Consortium. The new cruise terminal will be 
able to accommodate two cruise ships at any given time.</p>

Naval Base Durban on Salisbury Island (now joined to the mainland and part of the Port of
 Durban), was established as a naval base during the Second World War. It was downgraded in 
2002 to a naval station. In 2012 a decision was made to renovate and expand the facilities 
back up to a full naval base to accommodate the South African Navy's offshore patrol flotilla. 
In December 2015 it was redesignated Naval Base Durban.</p>
