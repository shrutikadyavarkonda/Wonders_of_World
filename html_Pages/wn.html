The Seven Natural Wonders of the world are a list of the world's most astonishing natural attractions.
The Seven Natural Wonders of the World</p>
<p align="justify">The Grand Canyon, in the USA, is one of the world's natural wonders.
 The Seven Wonders of the World demonstrate humanity's most impressive creations such as the Taj Mahal and the statue of Christ the Redeemer.
 In the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, ancientmasterpieces such as the Temple of Artemis and the Hanging Gardens of Babylon are remembered.
 However, the Seven Wonders of the Natural World are proof — if proof is needed — that Mother Nature is just as talented an architect.
Compiled by CNN and Seven Natural Wonders in 1997, this list spans all 7 continents, and includes some of the greatest heights of the earth and depths
 of the oceans, some lesser known sites, and some well-known features that you may have already visited yourself. 
The seven wonders of the ancient world have been celebrated by scholars, writers, and artists since at least 200 B.C. These marvels of architecture, 
like Egypt's pyramids, were monuments of human achievement, built by Mediterranean and Middle Eastern empires of their day with little more than 
crude tools and manual labor. </p>
<p align="justify">Today, all but one of these ancient wonders have vanished.
While the locations of the world's most breathtaking wonders are often disputed, these seven locations are generally agreed upon as being
 among the most breathtaking natural sights anywhere in the world.
Our world is full of wonders. From the evolution of Human life to till date, People are busy in exploring these wonders. 
Many of them are still hidden and undiscovered yet. These spectacular structures always inspires us and shows us that there is a a power
 who created all these mighty things. Compiling a list of top 10 natural wonders of the world is never an easy task because various lists of
 the Wonders of the World have been compiled from ancient to the present day, to catalog the most spectacular natural wonders and man-made structures.
Similar to the other lists of wonders, there is no consensus on a list of ten natural wonders of the world, and there has been a debate over how large
 the list should be. We did our best to compile this top 10 natural wonders of the world in a list.
