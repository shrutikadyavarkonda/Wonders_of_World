<th><h1><u>Komodo</u></h1>

<p align="justify">
Komodo is one of the 17,508 islands that make up Indonesia. It was made a national park in 1980 to protect the Komodo dragon, an endangered species.
 It’s also famous for its pink beaches, one of only a few in the world. Due to its location to Bali, it’s one of the more visited islands in Indonesia.
Komodo is one of the 17,508 islands that compose the Republic of Indonesia. The island is particularly notable as the habitat of the Komodo dragon, 
the largest lizard on Earth, which is named after the island. Komodo Island has a surface area of 390 square kilometres and a human population of
 over two thousand. The people of the island are descendants of former convicts who were exiled to the island and who have mixed with Bugis from Sulawesi.
 The people are primarily adherents of Islam but there are also Christian and Hindu congregations.
Komodo is part of the Lesser Sunda chain of islands and forms part of the Komodo National Park. In addition, the island is a popular destination for diving. 
Administratively, it is part of the East Nusa Tenggara province.Komodo Dragon Island is my final stop in Asia, and one of the more complicated ones to reach. 
I actually wondered if it was worth the effort to see some of the biggest lizards in the world. After much thought, I decided to pull the trigger,
 because I do want to see all Seven Wonders of Nature.</p>
<p align="justify">There are three main airlines that fly into Labuan Bajo:<br>

•	Wings Abadi Airlines<br>
•	Nam Air (also known as SRIWIJAYA AIR)<br>
•	Garuda Indonesia<br>

Keep in mind, Indonesia has a terrible safety track record. Apparently, their airline carriers break so many safety regulations,
 they are not allowed to fly to Europe. That certainly did not put my mind at ease…
Regardless, from the three carriers above, Garuda Indonesia has the best ratings but also the most expensive.
I chose Nam Air because it has better ratings than Wings Abadi Airlines but without the expensive price of Garuda Indonesia.
How to see the Komodo Dragon Island
To see the Komodo Dragon Island, you must first fly into Bali, Indonesia. After reaching Bali, you will then fly to another 
town called Labuan Bajo which is the launching pad for the Komodo Dragon Island toursThis turned out to be a wise decision 
because the plane made it safely on the return flight that I took.</p>
