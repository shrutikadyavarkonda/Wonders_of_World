<th><h1><u>Taj Mahal</u></h1>
<hr size="5" color="black">
<hr size="5" color="black">
<h2> 
<p align="justify">
The Taj Mahal is located on the right bank of the Yamuna River in a vast Mughal garden that encompasses nearly 17 hectares, in the
 Agra District in Uttar Pradesh. It was built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal with construction 
starting in 1632 AD and completed in 1648 AD, with the mosque, the guest house and the main gateway on the south, the outer 
courtyard and its cloisters were added subsequently and completed in 1653 AD. The existence of several historical and Quaranic inscriptions 
in Arabic script have facilitated setting the chronology of Taj Mahal.</p>
<p align="justify"> For its construction, masons, stone-cutters, inlayers, carvers, painters, calligraphers, dome builders and other artisans were requisitioned 
from the whole of the empire and also from the Central Asia and Iran. Ustad-Ahmad Lahori was the main architect of the Taj Mahal.
The Taj Mahal is considered to be the greatest architectural achievement in the whole range of Indo-Islamic architecture.
 Its recognised architectonic beauty has a rhythmic combination of solids and voids, concave and convex and light shadow; 
such as arches and domes further increases the aesthetic aspect. The colour combination of lush green scape reddish pathway
 and blue sky over it show cases the monument in ever changing tints and moods. The relief work in marble and inlay with precious
 and semi precious stones make it a monument apart. </p>
<p align="justify">The uniqueness of Taj Mahal lies in some truly remarkable innovations carried out by the horticulture planners and architects of Shah Jahan. 
One such genius planning is the placing of tomb at one end of the quadripartite garden rather than in the exact centre, which added rich 
depth and perspective to the distant view of the monument. It is also, one of the best examples of raised tomb variety. The tomb is further
 raised on a square platform with the four sides of the octagonal base of the minarets extended beyond the square at the corners. 
The top of the platform is reached through a lateral flight of steps provided in the centre of the southern side. The ground plan of the
 Taj Mahal is in perfect balance of composition, the octagonal tomb chamber in the centre, encompassed by the
 portal halls and the four corner rooms. The plan is repeated on the upper floor. The exterior of the tomb is square in plan, with chamfered corners. 
The large double storied domed chamber, which houses the cenotaphs of Mumtaz Mahal and Shah Jahan, is a perfect octagon in plan. 
The exquisite octagonal marble lattice screen encircling both cenotaphs is a piece of superb workmanship. It is highly polished and 
richly decorated with inlay work. The borders of the frames are inlaid with precious stones representing flowers executed with wonderful
 perfection. The hues and the shades of the stones used to make the leaves and the flowers appear almost real. The cenotaph of Mumtaz Mahal
 is in perfect centre of the tomb chamber, placed on a rectangular platform decorated with
 inlaid flower plant motifs. The cenotaph of Shah Jahan is greater than Mumtaz Mahal and installed more than thirty years later 
by the side of the latter on its west. The upper cenotaphs are only illusory and the real graves are in the lower tomb chamber (crypt),
 a practice adopted in the imperial Mughal tombs.</p>
<p align="justify">The four free-standing minarets at the corners of the platform added a hitherto unknown dimension to the Mughal architecture. 
The four minarets provide not only a kind of spatial reference to the monument but also give a three dimensional effect to the edifice.
The most impressive in the Taj Mahal complex next to the tomb, is the main gate which stands majestically in the centre of the southern
 wall of the forecourt. The gate is flanked on the north front by double arcade galleries. The garden in front of the galleries is subdivided 
into four quarters by two main walk-ways and each quarters in turn subdivided by the narrower cross-axial walkways, on the Timurid-Persian 
he enclosure walls on the east and west have a pavilion at the centre.</p>
<p align="justify">The Taj Mahal is a perfect symmetrical planned building, with an emphasis of bilateral symmetry along a central axis on which the main features are placed.
 The building material used is brick-in-lime mortar veneered with red sandstone and marble and inlay work of precious/semi precious stones. 
The mosque and the guest house in the Taj Mahal complex are built of red sandstone in contrast to the marble tomb in the centre. 
Both the buildings have a large platform over the terrace at their front. Both the mosque and the guest house are the identical structures. 
They have an oblong massive prayer hall consist of three vaulted bays arranged in a row with central dominant portal.
 The frame of the portal arches and the spandrels are veneered in white marble. The spandrels are filled with flowery arabesques of stone intarsia 
and the arches bordered with rope molding.</p>
<p align="justify">Standing majestically on the banks of River Yamuna, the Taj Mahal is synonymous to love and romance. The name "Taj Mahal" was derived from the 
name of Shah Jahan's wife, Mumtaz Mahal, and means "Crown Palace". The purity of the white marble, the exquisite ornamentation, precious gemstones
 used and its picturesque location, all make a visit to the Taj Mahal gain a place amongst the most sought-after tours in the world. However, until you know 
the love story behind the construction of the Taj Mahal, the beauty of the same would not enliven in your heart and mind and instead would come up as just
 another beautiful building/monument. It is the love behind this outstanding monument that has given a life to this monument. Come and explore the visceral 
charisma that it emanates</p>
<p align="justify">At the brink of dawn when the first rays of the sun hits the dome of this epic monument, it radiates like a heavenly abode, cloaked in bright golden. And then at
 dusk, basking in the glory of moon, it shines like a perfectly carved diamond; appearing as if straight owwut of some magical tale, leaving the viewers awestruck
 by its sense of grandeur. Nothing short of an architectural marvel, no wonder it stands proud at being one of the Seven Wonders of the World. And the rich beauty 
of this visual spectacle turns visceral when one hears the story behind it. The story of Taj Mahal!
Taj Mahal, "the epitome of love", is "a monument of immeasurable beauty". The beauty of this magnificent monument is such that it is beyond the scope of words.
The thoughts that come into the mind while watching the Taj Mahal of Agra is not just its phenomenal beauty, but the immense love which was the reason behind its
 construction. Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan got this monument constructed in the memory of his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal, with whom he fell in love at the first 
sight. Ironically, the very first sight of the Taj Mahal, the epitome of love and romance, also leaves visitors mesmerized and perpetually enthralled.
The Taj Mahal has been able to pass through history without suffering any particular damage, which makes it possible to admire it nowadays as it was at its 
construction. If the mausoleum is the best known, it is not necessary to reduce this monument to this marble construction, the Taj Mahal is in fact a set of buildings, 
gardens, lakes and fountains with perfectly organized symmetry contained in a rectangular ground of 580 by 305 meters. It includes two mosques, one of which is
 unused because it is not oriented towards Mecca, symmetry obligatory, three Iranian-style gates, three red brick buildings, a central fountain and four bodies of 
water organized in a cross. The Taj Mahal is visited annually by 4 million visitors, making it the most visited monument in India. It is also the most famous monument
 in India, and its symbol, such as the Statue of Liberty is for the United States, the Eiffel Tower for France,
 or the statue of Christ the Redeemer for Brazil.</p>
