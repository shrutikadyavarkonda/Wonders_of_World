The Colosseum or Coliseum (/k?l?'si??m/ kol-?-SEE-?m), also known as the Flavian 
Amphitheatre (Latin: Amphitheatrum Flavium; Italian: Anfiteatro Flavio [a?fite'a?tro 'fla?vjo] or Colosseo
 [kolos's??o]), is an oval amphitheatre in the centre of the city of Rome, Italy. Built of travertine, tuff, and brick-faced 
concrete,it is the largest amphitheatre ever built. The Colosseum is situated just east of
 the Roman Forum. Construction began under the emperor Vespasian in AD 72,and was completed 
in AD 80 under his successor and heir Titus.Further modifications were made during the reign of
 Domitian (81–96). These three emperors are known as the Flavian dynasty, and the amphitheatre was 
named in Latin for its association with their family name (Flavius)
The Colosseum could hold, it is estimated, between 50,000 and 80,000 spectators,having an average
 audience of some 65,000; it was used for gladiatorial contests and public spectacles such as mock
 sea battles (for only a short time as the hypogeum was soon filled in with mechanisms to support the other activities), 
animal hunts, executions, re-enactments of famous battles, and dramas based on Classical mythology. 
The building ceased to be used for entertainment in the early medieval era. It was later reused for such
 purposes as housing, workshops, quarters for a religious order, a fortress, a quarry, and a Christian shrine.
Although partially ruined because of damage caused by earthquakes and stone-robbers,
 the Colosseum is still an iconic symbol of Imperial Rome and is listed as one of the New7Wonders of the World.
It is one of Rome's most popular tourist attractions and also has links to the Roman Catholic Church, as each Good Friday
 the Pope leads a torchlit "Way of the Cross" procession that starts in the area around the Colosseum.
Located just east of the Roman Forum, the massive stone amphitheater known as the Colosseum was commissioned around A.D. 70-72 by 
Vespasian of the Flavian dynasty as a gift to the Roman people. In A.D. 80, Vespasian’s son Titus opened the Colosseum–officially known as the Flavian
 Amphitheater–with 100 days of games, including gladiatorial combats and wild animal fights. After four centuries of active use, the magnificent arena fell
 into neglect, and up until the 18th century it was used as a source of building materials. Though two-thirds of the original Colosseum has been destroyed over time, 
the amphitheater remains a popular tourist destination, as well as an iconic symbol of Rome and its long, tumultuous history.
of the Colosseum.</p><p align="justify">
Even after the decadent Roman emperor Nero took his own life in A.D. 68, his misrule and excesses fueled a series of civil wars. No fewer than four emperors 
took the throne in the tumultuous year after Nero’s death; the fourth, Vespasian, would end up ruling for 10 years (A.D. 69-79). The Flavian emperors, as Vespasian 
and his sons Titus (79-81) and Domitian (81-96) were known, attempted to tone down the excesses of the Roman court, restore Senate authority and promote public 
welfare. Around 70-72, Vespasian returned to the Roman people the lush land near the center of the city, where Nero had built an enormous palace for himself after
 a great fire ripped through Rome in A.D. 64. On the site of that Golden Palace, he decreed, would be built a new amphitheater where the public could enjoy 
gladiatorial combats and other forms of entertainment.
After nearly a decade of construction–a relatively quick time period for a project of such a grand scale–Titus officially dedicated the Colosseum in A.D. 80 with
 a festival including 100 days of games. A well-loved ruler, Titus had earned his people’s devotion with his handling of recovery efforts after the infamous eruption 
of Vesuvius in A.D. 79, which destroyed the towns of Herculaneum and Pompeii. The final stages of construction of the Colosseum were completed under the reign 
of
 Titus’ brother and successor, Domitian.</p>
<p align="justify">Measuring some 620 by 513 feet (190 by 155 meters), the Colosseum was the largest amphitheater in the Roman world. Unlike many earlier amphitheaters,
 which had been dug into hillsides to provide adequate support, the Colosseum was a freestanding structure made of stone and concrete. The distinctive exterior
 had three stories of arched entrances–a total of around 80–supported by semi-circular columns. Each story contained columns of a different order (or style): 
At the bottom were columns of the relatively simple Doric order, followed by Ionic and topped by the ornate Corinthian order. Located just near the main entrance 
to the Colosseum was the Arch of Constantine, built in A.D. 315 in honor of Constantine I’s victory over Maxentius at Pons Milvius.
Inside, the Colosseum had seating for more than 50,000 spectators, who may have been arranged according to social ranking but were most likely packed into the space like sardines in a can (judging by evidence from the seating at other Roman amphitheaters). Awnings were unfurled from the top story in order to protect the audience from the hot Roman sun as they watched gladiatorial combats, hunts, wild animal fights and larger combats such as mock naval engagements (for which the arena was flooded with water) put on at great expense. The vast majority of the combatants who fought in front of Colosseum audiences in Ancient Rome were men (though there were some female gladiators). Gladiators were generally slaves, condemned criminals or prisoners of war.
</p><p align="justify">
The Colosseum saw some four centuries of active use, until the struggles of the Western Roman Empire and the gradual change in public
 tastes put an end to gladiatorial combats and other large public entertainments by the 6th century A.D. Even by that time, the arena had 
suffered damaged due to natural phenomena such as lightning and earthquakes. In the centuries to come, the Colosseum was abandoned completely, 
and used as a quarry for numerous building projects, including the cathedrals of St. Peter and St. John Lateran, the Palazzo Venezia and defense fortifications
 along the Tiber River. Beginning in the 18th century, however, various popes sought to conserve the arena as a sacred Christian site, though it is in fact uncertain 
whether early Christian martyrs met their fate in the Colosseum, as has been speculated.
By the 20th century, a combination of weather, natural disasters, neglect and vandalism had destroyed nearly two-thirds of the original Colosseum,
 including all of the arena’s marble seats and its decorative elements. Restoration efforts began in the 1990s, and have proceeded over the years, 
as the Colosseum continues to be a leading attraction for tourists from all over the world.
