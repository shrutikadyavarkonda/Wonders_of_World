Many Asian countries have a must-visit offshore island – Singapore has Sentosa, Thailand has Phuket, and Indonesia has Bali. For South Korea, 
the top island destination is undoubtedly the picturesque Jeju Island.Korea’s largest island, has long been the country’s favourite domestic holiday
 destination thanks to its beautiful beaches, lush countryside and seaside hotels designed for rest and relaxation.
Jeju Island is an island in Jeju Province, South Korea. The island lies in the Korea Strait, south of South Jeolla Province. 
The island contains the natural World Heritage Site Jeju Volcanic Island and Lava Tubes. Jejudo has a moderate climate; even in winter, the temperature rarely
 falls below 0 °C (32 °F). Jeju is a popular holiday destination and a sizable portion of the economy relies on tourism and economic activity from its civil/naval base.
rom April 3, 1948 to May 1949, the South Korean government conducted an anticommunist campaign to suppress an attempted uprising on the island.[9][10] The main cause for the rebellion was the election scheduled for May 10, 1948, designed by the United Nations Temporary Commission on Korea (UNTCOK) to create a new government for all of Korea[11]. The elections were only planned for the south of the country, the half of the peninsula under UNTCOK control. Fearing that the elections would further reinforce division, guerrilla fighters for the South Korean Labor party (SKLP) reacted violently, attacking local police and rightist youth groups stationed on Jeju Island.[10][12]

Atrocities were committed by both sides, but those by South Korean government forces are the best-documented. On one occasion, American soldiers 
discovered the bodies of 97 people who had been killed by government forces. On another, American soldiers encountered police who were executing 76
 villagers.Between 14,000 and 30,000 people died as a result of the rebellion, or up to 10% of the island’s total population. Some 40,000 others fled to Japan to 
escape the fighting. In the decades after the uprising, memory of the event was suppressed by the government through strict punishment.
 However, in 2006, the Korean government apologized for its role in the killings and promised reparations. As of 2010, these had not been paid.
In 2008, bodies of victims of a massacre were discovered in a mass grave near Jeju International Airport.
